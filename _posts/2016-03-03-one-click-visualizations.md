We have streamlined the visualization discovery process for the case when you have your RDF file with only one meaningful possible visualization.
This means that you get this visualization on one click.
Try it out with a SKOS concept scheme or an RDF data cube!
If you don't have your own data, try e.g. the [EU programmes](http://publications.europa.eu/mdr/resource/authority/eu-programme/skos/eu-programme-skos.rdf) and switch to Tree visualization.
