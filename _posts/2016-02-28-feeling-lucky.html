title: Feeling lucky

<p class="center">You can click on &quot;Feeling lucky&quot; button and see what visualization of your data we will choose.
For example, if you want to visualize a data cube and you also provide SKOS concept schemes used on dimensions,
 when you simply click on &quot;Visualize&quot;, you will have to choose from the Data cube visualizer and the Concept scheme visualizer.
In this particular case, you probably want the data cube visualizer and that is what you get when you are feeling lucky.
